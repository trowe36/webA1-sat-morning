1. error logging in. Loggin in with incorrect credentials allows you to view the authenticated map chart component 
2. Map and chart are still hardcoded. 
3. Code quality and design 

working in myMap() -> lat and long is passed via props but wont display like it did when i had it hardcoded. 
- not hardcoded but has bugs. chart and map. maybe just leave for tut. 


-------------------

I THINK need use effect on myMap with dependency of ID. so that everytime ID of volcano chnages. the map is re-rendered. 
fix map first then do chart. 


REMAINING FEATURES (mostly needed for a 7.): 
- css design 
- Check login details and display as incorrect if server replies not OK 
- Login error handling: password missing, loggin missing, password or username incorrect (if password incorrect), user does not exist in system. 
- once user logs in create popup that says successfully logged in and redirect user to the volcanos page 
- Cannot register new email if the username does not fit email parameters. also require particular password length to sign up 
- Have element in header/navbar that displays logged in state. eg if(loggedin) ->logout button deactivated and vice versa. if logged in register button is deactivated. 
            only activated once logged out. (have to log out before registering)
- Stop dropdown menu from taking up entire screen.
- Centre grid data. format text data displaying volcano information. 
- LARGER FEATURE: query /volcanoes?country=Japan&populatedWithin=10km  20km etc feature/api call. add label populatedWithin: then dropdown with the 4 values. then search. 
            have this search query endpoint based on data in dropdown box. reset the row data based on volcanos that have population within this range. 
- ensure pagination is working. 
- would be good for 7 to design an autocomplete text component to the dropdown menu. For instance users can scrolll for country name alphabetically but they can also
    search and the dropdown automatically sorts entrys based on the user input (leave till later probs) task: "client side filtering and sorted - looked favourably" 
- Map GPS coordinate point graphic doesnt move when the user scrolls out 
- userability eg coding for disabled people. 
- Code quality/refactoring (ask tuts their opinion on what code of mine is bad)
- put country in dropdown. then set 30km. then change country. Will not show new country with 30km, will only show all volcanos from that country.
        maybe once popwithin is set this sets a global state variable that impacts the query when country is changed back. 

- website adjusts for screen width. 

Test Case: 
1. correct endpoints
